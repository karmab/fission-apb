# fission-apb

fission core apb based on existing helm chart 
based on [https://github.com/fission/fission/tree/master/charts/fission-core](https://github.com/fission/fission/tree/master/charts/fission-core)

## contents

- fission-apb ansible code
- yaml to create/delete serviceinstance

## requisites

- an openshift instance with ansible service broker enabled
- the destination project already created as creating projects is forbidden by ASB api
- you also need to set *sandbox_role* to *cluster-admin* in the *broker-config* configmap ( in the ansible-service-broker project) and restart broker afterwards( for instance by deleting the asb* pod )
-
## how to make apb available

```
apb build
apb push
```

## how to create a serviceinstance

edit the launch.yml and set the desired parameters (make sure that the project to use already exists). then

```
oc create -f launch.yml
```

## troubleshooting

you can use the [*helper\_script ansible_logs.sh*](helper_scripts/ansible_logs.sh) to see the provisioning of your service


## STATUS

can only be used manually from a cluster-admin account because of missing privileges. For this, the asb role is commented in the playbooks

```
sudo yum -y install python-virtualenv git
virtualenv openshift
source openshift/bin/activate
pip install ansible openshift
ansible-galaxy install ansible.kubernetes-modules
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=roles
ansible-playbook playbooks/provision.yml -e namespace=default
```

those are the errors beeing faced 

- failing when trying to make cluster role bindings (necessary for fission crd) or trying to create namespaces. APB cant be used to do actions clusterwide
refer to [manually.md](manually.md) for additional operations
- also fail when commenting this part with the following
```
